# SWENG-LCA

This repository contains my solution for the LCA assignment for the CSU33012 module.

I wrote the initial solution for a binary tree in branch master. I then wrote the DAG solution in a new branch called DAG.
Finally I merged the DAG branch with master so that the master branch now contains the solutions for both problems.

My coded solution for this problem is in src/LCA.java and my tests are in src/LCAtest.java
The tests require junit4 in order to be run.
